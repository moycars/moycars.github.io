# [](#about)About

My Dad has a collection of 50+ model cars for sale.
These cars were bought during the 1980s and have been stored in a wardrobe since then.
This collection includes:

- 45 *Matchbox* Cars
- 8 *Solido* Cars

All of the *Models of Yesteryear* model cars are in their original boxes and most of these boxes have never been opened at all.

We are based in [Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Newcastle+NSW/@-32.9765848,151.5496153,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b733e1371c702e5:0x4017d681632a8a0!8m2!3d-32.9282712!4d151.7816802?dcr=0). 
If you are looking to buy individual cars, we can post these to anywhere in Australia.
We can also ship internationally, but we will only be able to do this for sales of 5 or more cars.

If you are interested in buying some cars from the collection please send an email to [modelsofyesteryear@gmail.com](mailto:modelsofyesteryear@gmail.com) with the model numbers of the cars you would like to buy.
We can also send you photos or more information about specific cars, if you would like.
